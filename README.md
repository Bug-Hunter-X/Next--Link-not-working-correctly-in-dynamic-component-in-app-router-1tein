# Next.js 15 App Router: Next/Link Issue in Dynamic Components

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using `next/link` within a component that's rendered dynamically in Next.js 15's App Router.  The `Next/Link` component doesn't behave as expected, potentially causing navigation issues or rendering problems.

## Description

The problem arises when using a component containing `Next/Link` which is dynamically imported or rendered (e.g., based on conditional rendering or data fetching).  In these situations, the links might not function correctly, leading to unexpected behavior or errors in the browser's console. This behavior differs significantly from Next.js 13's pages router and can introduce complexities to applications that frequently use dynamic rendering.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe the behavior of the links on the page.  They may not navigate correctly or throw errors in the console.

## Solution
The solution is to ensure that the component containing Next/Link is rendered correctly using the App Router's context, and that the `href` property of Next/Link is a valid path.
